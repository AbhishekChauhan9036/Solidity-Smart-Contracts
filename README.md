# Solidity Learning Path

## Overview

This repository provides a structured 15-day Solidity learning path, covering essential concepts in Solidity, smart contract development, and blockchain interaction. It is free and open-source for anyone interested in learning Solidity.

## Features

- Step-by-step Solidity lectures
- Practical smart contract examples
- Hands-on learning with Hardhat or Truffle
- Open-source and free for all learners

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) compiler (via npm or Hardhat/Truffle)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) for interacting with smart contracts

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AbhishekChauhan9036/Solidity-Smart-Contracts
   cd Solidity-Smart-Contracts
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
